Using the program:

When the program is run, the user will notice a number of buttons drawn onto the
screen. On the right side of the screen, the user is given a visual key to
understand what information the differently displayed colors are encoding (in
this version of the project, representing player rankings in term of 
percentile), and below this key will be scroll buttons allowing the user to 
move up and down the list of players to see information about those who haven't
yet been drawn to the screen. On the bottom left of the display are buttons
to change which particular task is being viewed, and when this is done, a
number of buttons will appear, based on how many objectives contained that
particular task. Clicking on any of the objective buttons will change the view
such that the clicked objective's column of colored bars is sorted from high 
percentile to low percentile, which gives the user more control over how 
information is displayed and giving them more ways to identify patterns in
user play. The bottom right hand corner also contains four buttons, currently
labeled "51+, 50-26, 25-1, and Did not improve." When selected, these buttons
will draw dark borders around those players who improved by a percentage in that
range.
