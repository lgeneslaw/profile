    <p1><br>Click to drag the nodes. The nodes are experiencing repulsive forces between each other as well as attractive forces via edges. These forces cause motion throughout the graph. The motion is quantified by the energy display at the top. When the energy drops below .1, the graph is considered to be in equilibrium and stops moving.</p1>
